# Conditional-GAN-CIFAR-10

<b>Conditional GAN implemented on the CIFAR-10 dataset</b>

The dataset CIFAR-10 was downloaded using Keras library.
The dataset is available here : https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Problem Statement : Implement Conditional GAN for CIFAR-10 dataset containing images belonging to 10 classes.

<b><h3>Approach :</h3></b>

<br>The datasets have been combined for better training of the Conditional GAN.
<br>Batch size has been taken as 50. Image size has been taken as 32x32.

<b>Generator Architecture</b>
<br>Noise taken as input.
<br>Randomly generated labels taken as input.
<br>Label embedding performed to generate image of corresponding label.
<br>Result of label embedding flattened and multiplied with noise.
<br>Resultant taken as input by network :
<ul>
<li>Dense layer 2048 units</li>
<li>Reshape - 2x2 with 512 filters - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2DTranspose - 256 filters - kernel size 5x5 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2DTranspose - 128 filters - kernel size 5x5 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2DTranspose - 64 filters - kernel size 5x5 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2DTranspose - 3 filters - kernel size 5x5 and strides size 2x2 - Activation layer tanh applied</li>
</ul>

<b>Discriminator Architecture</b>
<br>Image passed to Discriminator taken as input.
<br>Labels passed to Discriminator taken as input.
<br>Image taken as input by network :
<ul>
<li>Gaussian Noise added to image to reduce overfitting and Standard Deviation taken as 0.1</li>
<li>Conv2D - 64 filters - kernel size 3x3 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2D - 128 filters - kernel size 3x3 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2D - 256 filters - kernel size 3x3 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Conv2D - 512 filters - kernel size 3x3 and strides size 2x2 - Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU applied</li>
<li>Flatten - resultant of Conv2D is flattened
</ul>
<br>Label embedding performed to classify image of corresponding label.
<br>Result of label embedding flattened and multiplied with resultant of network.
<br>Dropout of 0.3 is taken
<br>Resultant with activation sigmoid determines whether image is genuine or fake.

<b>Combined Model</b>
<ul>
<li>Discriminator is declared and compiled</li>
<li>Generator is declared</li>
<li>Noise is fed to Generator</li>
<li>Generator image is fed to discriminator</li>
<li>Combined model is declared and compiled</li>
</ul>

<b>Training</b>
<br>Images normalized between -1 and 1.
<br>For 10% of images, labels flipped.
<br>Image generated by generator.
<br>Discriminator trained using real images and generated images and loss calculated.
<br>Generator trained using noise and loss calculated.
  
<b><h3>For 20 epochs, results are :</h3></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Discriminator Loss : 0.683838 | Generator Loss : 0.769194 |</b> after completion of epoch 4.
